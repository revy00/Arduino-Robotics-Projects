# Arduino-Robotics-Projects

Welcome to the **Arduino Robotics Projects** repository! This repository showcases a collection of fundamental yet impactful Arduino-based robotics projects, designed to help enthusiasts, students, and developers understand embedded systems and automation.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Line Following Robot (LFR)
A self-navigating robot that follows a predefined path using infrared sensors.
- **Components:** Arduino, IR sensors, Motor driver (L298N), DC motors, Chassis, Battery pack
- **Principle:** The IR sensors differentiate between light and dark surfaces, guiding the robot along a designated path.
- **Applications:** Industrial automation, warehouse logistics, smart transport systems

### 2. Bluetooth-Controlled Robot
A remotely operated robot that responds to user commands via a smartphone app using Bluetooth communication.
- **Components:** Arduino, HC-05/HC-06 Bluetooth module, Motor driver (L298N), DC motors, Smartphone
- **Principle:** The Bluetooth module establishes a wireless connection with a mobile device, allowing real-time control via serial communication.
- **Applications:** Wireless robotic systems, home automation, surveillance robots

### 3. Obstacle Avoidance Robot
An autonomous robot that intelligently detects and avoids obstacles in its path using ultrasonic sensing.
- **Components:** Arduino, Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04), Motor driver (L298N), DC motors, Chassis, Battery pack
- **Principle:** The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures distances, and upon detecting an obstacle, the system adjusts its path accordingly.
- **Applications:** Autonomous navigation, security patrol robots, search-and-rescue operations
